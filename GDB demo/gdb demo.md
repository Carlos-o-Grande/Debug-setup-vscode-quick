# GDB Debugging Investigation: The Infinite Loop Mystery

## Step 1: Discover the Problem and Prepare for Debugging

**Problem:** Let's run the program and see what happens.

```bash
gcc test.c -o test
./test
```

**Observation:** The program prints array values but never stops - it's an infinite loop! Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

**Prepare for debugging:** To use GDB effectively, we need debugging symbols (variable names, line numbers, etc.) compiled into our program.

```bash
gcc -g test.c -o test
```

**Observation:** The program size is slightly larger now because it includes debugging information. Performance is essentially the same - the `-g` flag doesn't affect optimization or runtime speed.

## Step 2: Launch GDB with Visual Interface and Control Execution

**Let's use GDB to investigate:** Start GDB with TUI (Text User Interface) for a visual view of the source code.

```bash
gdb -tui ./test
```

**Inside GDB, set a breakpoint and run:**

```gdb
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
```

**Explain:**
- TUI mode: Shows source code in top panel, commands in bottom. Toggle with `Ctrl+X` then `A`
- `Ctrl+L`: Refresh screen if display gets messy
- `break main`: Sets a breakpoint to pause at the start of main function

**Observation:** The program stops at the first line of main() before any code executes. In TUI mode, an arrow or highlight shows the current line, giving us full control to examine variables and step through code.

## Step 3: Step Through and Examine Variables

**Investigation:** Let's execute the code line by line and check what's happening to our variables.

```gdb
(gdb) next
(gdb) print i
(gdb) next
(gdb) print i
(gdb) next
(gdb) print i
```

**Explain:**
- `next` (or `n`): Executes one line at a time
- `print` (or `p`): Shows current value of a variable
- In TUI mode, watch the arrow move line by line

**Observation:** First `next` declares variables (uninitialized values). After `i = 0` executes, `print i` shows 0. Loop iterations show `i` incrementing (0, 1, 2...). This is manual step-by-step tracking - foundational but tedious.

## Step 4: Use Watch for Automatic Monitoring

**Problem:** Typing `print i` after every step is tedious. Let's use `watch` to automatically show us when `i` changes.

```gdb
(gdb) watch i
(gdb) continue
```

**Explain:**
- `watch`: Monitors a variable and stops execution whenever its value changes, showing old and new values
- `continue` (or `c`): Runs program normally until next breakpoint, watchpoint, or program end
- Tip: Press Enter to repeat the last command

**Observation:** GDB automatically stops each time `i` is modified and displays "Old value = X, New value = Y". We see `i` incrementing: 0→1, 1→2, 2→3... Keep pressing Enter to watch the pattern.

## Step 5: Examine Memory Layout

**Investigation:** Let's look at where our variables are stored in memory and what values are there.

```gdb
(gdb) print &i
(gdb) print &a[0]
(gdb) print &a[10]
(gdb) x/12uw &a[0]
```

**Explain:**
- `&`: Shows the memory address where a variable is stored (in hexadecimal)
- `x/12uw`: Examine memory command. Format: `x/[count][format][size] address`
  - `12` = examine 12 units (12 complete `unsigned int` values)
  - `u` = display **values** as unsigned decimal
  - `w` = word size (4 bytes, same as `unsigned int`)
  - Addresses shown in hex, values in decimal. GDB displays 4 values per line for readability.

**Example output and analysis:**
```
(gdb) x/12uw &a[0]
0x7fffffffdec0: 0    0    0    0    ← a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]
0x7fffffffdec0: 0    0    0    0    ← a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]
0x7fffffffded0: 0    0    0    11   ← a[8], a[9], a[10], ??? (12th value)
```

**What we're seeing:** We requested 12 `unsigned int` values starting from `a[0]`. Our array only has 11 elements (a[0] through a[10]), so the 12th value is whatever's stored in memory right after the array. Here it shows 11 - that's likely `i`! Each `unsigned int` takes 4 bytes, so memory addresses increment by 4 for each element.

**Observation:** The memory location right after our array contains the value of `i`. This means accessing `a[11]` would write directly into `i`'s memory location!

## Step 6: Set Up Permanent Display

**Investigation:** Let's restart fresh and set up permanent monitoring of key variables.

```gdb
(gdb) delete
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) display i
(gdb) display &i
(gdb) display &a[11]
```

**Explain:**
- `delete`: Removes all breakpoints and watchpoints to start clean
- `display`: Automatically shows values every time GDB stops - no need to keep typing `print`

**Observation:** Now every time GDB stops, we'll automatically see the values of `i`, its address, and the address of `a[11]`.

## Step 7: Jump to the Bug and Witness It

**Investigation:** Instead of stepping through all iterations, let's jump straight to when `i` becomes 11.

```gdb
(gdb) delete breakpoints
(gdb) break 42 if i == 11
(gdb) continue
(gdb) next
```

**Explain:**
- `break 42 if i == 11`: Conditional breakpoint - only stops when the condition is true

**Observation:** The program runs until `i` reaches 11. Notice `&i` and `&a[11]` show the same address! After `next`, watch the display - `i` changed from 11 to 0! We overwrote our loop counter, causing the infinite loop.

## Step 8: The Solution

**Understanding the bug:** Array `a[11]` has valid indices 0-10. When we access `a[11]`, we write beyond the array boundary into where `i` is stored, resetting it to 0.

**The fix:** Change the loop condition from `i < 12` to `i < 11` to match the array size.

**Key lesson:** GDB helps visualize what's happening in memory - making debugging faster and more intuitive than printf debugging alone.
